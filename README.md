All the codes are successfully runnning in python 3 as of now.

Following are the topics included:
1. Noise Removal
2. Lexicon Normalization
     * Lemmatization
     * Stemming
3. Object Standardization
4. Syntactical Parsing
     * POS Tagging
5. Entity Parsing
     * Topic Modelling(LDA)
     * Bi-Grams
6. Statistical features
     * TF â€“ IDF
7. Text Classification
     * TextBlob with naive bayes
     * Sklearn with SVM
8. Text Matching
     * Levenshtein Distance
     * Phonetic Matching
